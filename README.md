## Scalability & Performance

This application has been designed to handle a scalable number of users. Below are key considerations for scalability:

- **Multi-User Support**: With cloud deployment using AWS and Kubernetes, the system can handle 1000+ concurrent users.
- **Load Balancing**: Using AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic and ensure smooth scaling.
- **Database Scalability**: SQLite is used for local data storage, but it can be replaced with a more scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for larger systems.
- **Containerization**: Docker containers provide isolated environments, enabling easy scaling and deployment across different platforms.
- **Real-time AI Processing**: AI models like resume generation, aptitude training, and speech-to-text processing are optimized for fast real-time interaction with minimal latency.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps after installation:

1. **AI Resume Builder**: Enter your details (name, qualifications, skills, etc.), and the system will generate a professional, ATS-friendly resume.
2. **Aptitude Training**: Take the aptitude test and receive detailed feedback and performance metrics.
3. **Competitive Exam Preparation**: Access personalized guidance and mock exams for your specific competitive exams.
4. **VocalScribe AI**: Speak into the microphone, and the system will convert your speech to text and generate a PDF report.
5. **Accessibility Tools**: Use tools like voice-to-text and sign language learning resources to improve communication and learning.
